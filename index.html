        <p class="body">Legendary sports is an app designed to allow adult users to locate, communicate with, and join local recreation teams in their area. Working with a small design team, I conceptualized and designed a mobile app, including initial idea brainstorming, user interviews, wireframing, user testing, and building a high-fidelity prototype.</p>

That nostalgia could be a solid starting point for catching the eye of a user like Michael’s.</p>

            <p class="h6">Color Palette</p>
            <p class="body">Our color palette was inspired by blue and orange, one of the most popular color schemes in sports. Blue and orange is used by teams like the Denver Broncos, Chicago Bears, and New York Knicks and Mets.</p>

      <p class="h3">Looking Back</p>
      <p class="body">Having completed this design studio, there are some specific things we would have done differently:</p>
      <ul class="body">
        <li>Due to some miscommunication on our design team between whether we were designing for iOS or using the Material Design Guidelines, our app’s overall design rests somewhere between the two. Improving overall communication would have avoided this.</li>
        <li>Our design process would have been more efficient had we built a component library. Although our design is consistent across screens, having to recreate design elements slowed down the overall design process.</li>
        <li>Scope creep was a definite issue for our team in this project. Given our limited time in our first design studio, it would have been better to focus on fewer features to maximize design consistency and to more thoroughly target our research.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="h3 forward">Looking Forward</p>
      <p class="body">In the future, we hope to iterate on this design in a number of specific ways, including:</p>
      <ul class="body">
        <li>Developing user flows for different types of users, such as coaches, team administrators, and fans.</li>
        <li>Researching and implementing a better way for users to join teams, rather than simply being automatically admitted.</li>
        <li>Designing a more interactive calendar to show practices and game dates.</li>
        <li>Including more features for showing league standings, tournament brackets, and player highlights.</li>
        <li>Designing a way for users to connect with their friends on the app.</li>
        <li>Designing a way for users to rate teams, similar to yelp reviews for teams.</li>
